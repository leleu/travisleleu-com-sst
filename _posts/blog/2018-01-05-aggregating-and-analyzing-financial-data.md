## The Signal and the Noise
Used to be there wasn't a ton of data out there.  The little available was applied to inefficient/unoptimized markets; even noisy data provided a competitive advantage to businesses.

Our problem now is the noise.  There might be useful information in the data out there, but how do we find and confirm the needle in the haystack?

In future posts, I should address those concerns.  For now, I'm just going to expand on a few of the ideas above, and work towards building a solution that propagates information to the right people.  While dropping out the noise.

## Data Explosion
For at least the past decade, we've been drowning in data.  Governments have pushed a ton of public data out into the ether.  Companies like StockTwit process tweets about companies and infer sentiment, then trade on that information.  Local newspapers have information about factory openings, closings, and major layoffs.  Online job boards can be scraped and analyzed over time to infer hiring trends.

## Disclaimer
These concepts may, in themselves, result in even more noise.  However, you start with raw ideas, and save the cross-validation & editing for a later stage.  I will go into those models at a later date; for now, think of this as a scratchpad.
