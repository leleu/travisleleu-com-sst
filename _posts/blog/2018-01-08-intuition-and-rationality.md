Great quotes from the F.S. article [Intuition vs. Rationality](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2018/01/intuition-rationality/).

<blockquote>
	You get your intuition back when you make space for it, when you stop the chattering of the rational mind. The rational mind doesn't nourish you. You assume that it gives you the truth, because the rational mind is the golden calf that this culture worships, but this is not true. Rationality squeezes out much that is rich and juicy and fascinating.
	--Anne Lamott, from her book Bird by Bird...
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	“It is through science that we prove, but through intuition that we discover.”
	--Henry Poincare
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	"It's not really acceptable to admit but most of the time we make our decisions on intuition, rationalizing them after the fact by cherry picking."
	--[Farnam Street Blog](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2018/01/intuition-rationality/)
